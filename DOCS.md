## Process Tab
- Processes are shown in Parent and Child relation with filtering algorithm to filter out the background processes that are not as usefull as the process that user creates. Process which have there origin from "/libexec" or has "deamon" or "dbus" are considered as background processes. It consists of tree like shortable structure from any column.
- The top of column(headers) shows the overall system performance matrics.

#### Each column
- Pid : Unique Process Id for the process
- Name  : Name of the process
- ***rCPU :** The overall cpu utilisation of the parent + cpu utilisation of all of its childs and childs of child. Being a recursive value. For the leaf process the CPU and rCPU would be same. 

  Example: Process FireFox
  
  The rCPU for the FireFox will be the sum of all the CPU utilisations of all its childs(web contents) and their rCPU and CPU column are same as they dont have childs.
  
  FireFox_rCPU = FireFox_CPU + All_child_CPU : 1.4 + 0.6 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.6 +0.1 =3.4

- CPU : CPU utilisation for that process
- ***rMemory :** Recursive Memory utilisation calculated similarily as rCPU. This gives a better idea as how much a process is using the memory.

  In the above example the "FireFox" uses 547.4 MiB as only one process which but as a whole with child it uses 3039 MiB which is the real truth. 
- Memory : the memory Utilisation of the Process which solely belongs to the process. Calculated as **Resident_Memory - Shared_Memory = Memory util of the process**.
- DiskRead : The disk read speed at which the process is doing IO operations.
- DiskWrite : The disk write speed at which the process is doing IO operations.
- ***rDiskRead:** Recursive Disk Read calculated similar to rMemory and rCPU. 
- ***rDiskWrite:** Recursive Disk Write similar to rDiskRead.
- Resident Memory: It is the actual memory that is in the physical memory associated to the given process(not only this process also includes the shared memory with other process)
- Shared : Shared memory with other processes.
- Owner : User that process belongs to.
- Command : The command corresponding to the process.

#### Killer
- It is a process kill button. Pressing it would cause process to get terminate after confirmation.
